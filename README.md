# Spring Playground
A repository for me to experiment with Spring/Spring Boot concepts

* 1. rest_service - Create a RESTful Web Service

* 2. consume - An application that consumes a RESTful web service. It consumes from quoters-masters

* 3. swagger -Implementation of Swagger using Open API. Swagger is a powerful framework for designing, building, documenting, and consuming RESTful APIs. OpenAPI, formerly known as the Swagger Specification, is a widely adopted standard for describing RESTful APIs. 

* 4. unittest - Learning on JUnit 5, a unit testing framework for Java. 

* 5. mockito - Learning on Mockito, implemented together with JUnit. Mockito is a mocking framework, which allows for creation of mocked objects. 

* 6. Spring-security - Implementation of a basic authentication page using Spring-security 

* 7. Jacoco - Implementation of Java code coverage. Use 'mvn test' to generate report.

* 8. JPA - Implementation fo Java Persistence API (JPA) on a Customer entity. Data is stored in H2 database. 

* 9. Task scheduling - Implement scheduling of task at fixed intervals. 

* 10. Caching - Implementation of caching a Spring managed bean, in this case on a simple book repository

* 11. Feign Client - Implementation of feign client. Good learning

* 12. Tanzu - Observability with VMWare's Tanzu

* 13. GraphQL - Built a GraphQL service, running the query and writing a GraphQL test

* 14. Exception handling - Handling exception at the controller level with annotations @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler
